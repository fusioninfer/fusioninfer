                            depend on the implementation. If a value is set in the spec and the
                            requested address is invalid or unavailable, the implementation MUST
                            indicate this in an associated entry in GatewayStatus.Conditions.

                            The Addresses field represents a request for the address(es) on the
                            "outside of the Gateway", that traffic bound for this Gateway will use.
                            This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or
                            other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will
                            be sent to.

                            If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
                            Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                            set of Addresses.

                            The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                            it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
                            GatewayStatus.Addresses.

                            attached to it, according to the scope configured here.

                            If unset (the default) or set to None, the Gateway will not act as a
                            default Gateway; if set, the Gateway will claim any Route with a
                            matching scope set in its UseDefaultGateway field, subject to the usual
                            rules about which routes the Gateway can attach to.

                            Think carefully before using this functionality! While the normal rules
                            about which Route can apply are still enforced, it is simply easier for
                            the wrong Route to be accidentally attached to this Gateway in this
                            configuration. If the Gateway operator is not also the operator in

                            what kind of workloads and Routes get added in that scope, we strongly
                            recommend not using this just because it seems convenient, and instead
                            stick to direct Route attachment.

                            logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
                            At least one Listener MUST be specified.

                            ## Distinct Listeners

                            Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
                            MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
                            exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                            "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                            from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                            apply in that case).

                            Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                            combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.

                            Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                            Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
                            they support:

                            HTTPRoute

                            1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
                            2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided

                            TLSRoute

                            1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough

                            "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:

                            **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                            Listener**.

                            When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                            example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                            can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                            Listener fields.

                            When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
                            each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
                            values for other fields.

                            The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
                            The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
                            Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
                            Gateway API spec.

                            The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
                            values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:

                            * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
                            * **TCP, UDP**: Port

                            One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
                            implementation:

                            * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
                              Listeners, and
                            * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
                              Protocol.

                            In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
                            TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.

                            If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
                            previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
                            accepted.

                            Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
                            Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.

                            ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname

                            When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
                            hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                            values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.

                            Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                            matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                            matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                            `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.

                            Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                            wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                            For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.

                            The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                            hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.

                            The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                            the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                            `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.

                            ## Handling indistinct Listeners

                            If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                            Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                            condition in the Listener Status to "True".

                            The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
                            purpose of this documentation.

                            Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                            Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                            no Conflicted Listeners.

                            Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
                            the following rules:

                            * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
                              ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
                            * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
                              contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.

                            The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                            Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                            not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                            indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                            Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                            indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.

                            ## General Listener behavior

                            Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
                            For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                            request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                            to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).

                            This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
                            of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
                            clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
                            `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.

                            Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
                            for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
                            conformance tests.

                            ## Compatible Listeners

                            A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:

                            1. They are distinct.
                            2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                               requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                               addresses.

                            Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                            implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                            may not be compatible for another.

                            For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                            on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                            would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.

                            Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                            Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                            In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

                                  AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a

                                  present.

                                  Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                                  may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                                  determined in order of the following criteria:

                                  * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                                  * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                                    a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                                    a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                                  * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                                    alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                                    example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.

                                  All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                                  implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                                  the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                                  support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                                  example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                                  of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                                  Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that
                                  define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This
                                  field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                                  matching.

                                  Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                                  the following protocols:

                                  * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                                  * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                                  * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match both the SNI and Host header.
                                    Note that this does not require the SNI and Host header to be the same.
                                    The semantics of this are described in more detail below.

                                  To ensure security, Section 11.1 of RFC-6066 emphasizes that server
                                  implementations that rely on SNI hostname matching MUST also verify
                                  hostnames within the application protocol.

                                  Section 9.1.2 of RFC-7540 provides a mechanism for servers to reject the
                                  reuse of a connection by responding with the HTTP 421 Misdirected Request
                                  status code. This indicates that the origin server has rejected the
                                  request because it appears to have been misdirected.

                                  To detect misdirected requests, Gateways SHOULD match the authority of
                                  the requests with all the SNI hostname(s) configured across all the
                                  Gateway Listeners on the same port and protocol:

                                  * If another Listener has an exact match or more specific wildcard entry,
                                    the Gateway SHOULD return a 421.
                                  * If the current Listener (selected by SNI matching during ClientHello)
                                    does not match the Host:
                                      * If another Listener does match the Host the Gateway SHOULD return a
                                        421.
                                      * If no other Listener matches the Host, the Gateway MUST return a
                                        404.

                                  For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                                  `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                                  there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                                  accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                                  documentation.

                                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                                            FrontendValidationMode defines the mode for validating the client certificate.
                                            There are two possible modes:

                                            - AllowValidOnly: In this mode, the gateway will accept connections only if
                                              the client presents a valid certificate. This certificate must successfully
                                              pass validation against the CA certificates specified in `CACertificateRefs`.
                                            - AllowInsecureFallback: In this mode, the gateway will accept connections
                                              even if the client certificate is not presented or fails verification.

                                              This approach delegates client authorization to the backend and introduce
                                              a significant security risk. It should be used in testing environments or
                                              on a temporary basis in non-testing environments.

                                            Defaults to AllowValidOnly.

                                                  There are two possible modes:

                                                  - AllowValidOnly: In this mode, the gateway will accept connections only if
                                                    the client presents a valid certificate. This certificate must successfully
                                                    pass validation against the CA certificates specified in `CACertificateRefs`.
                                                  - AllowInsecureFallback: In this mode, the gateway will accept connections
                                                    even if the client certificate is not presented or fails verification.

                                                    This approach delegates client authorization to the backend and introduce
                                                    a significant security risk. It should be used in testing environments or
                                                    on a temporary basis in non-testing environments.

                                                  Defaults to AllowValidOnly.

                            Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                            header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                            MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                            performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                            configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.

                            Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                            hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                            1. IPs are not allowed.
                            2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                               label must appear by itself as the first label.

                            If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                            must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                            attached to the Listener. For example:

                            * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                              that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                              least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                            * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                              that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                              one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                              `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                              all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                              not match.

                            Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                            as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                            both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                            If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                            HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                            ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                            HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                            `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

                            If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                            match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                            implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                            `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                            In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                            overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                            be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:

                            * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                            * Characters in a matching hostname.

                            If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                            HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                            ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                            to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                            allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                            the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                            namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                            namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                            and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                            not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                            create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                            Route.

                            There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                            This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                            resources.

                            ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                            * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                              entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                              multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                              be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                            * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                              each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                              optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                              combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                            Some examples:

                            * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                              same object must also set `sectionName`.
                            * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                              object must also set `port`.
                            * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                              referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                            It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                            be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                            choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                            case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                            merged.

                            Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                            rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

                              ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                              a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources

                              This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent

                              be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                              HTTPRouteRule defines semantics for matching an HTTP request based on
                              conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                              an API object (backendRefs).
                            properties:
                              backendRefs:

                                  BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                                  sent.

                                  Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                                  how many are invalid.

                                  If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                                  specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                                  receive a 500 status code.

                                  See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                                  HTTPBackendRef invalid.

                                  When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                                  requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                                  multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                                  requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                                  MUST receive a 500 status code.

                                  For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                                  invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                                  choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                                  When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,
                                  implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead.
                                  If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses
                                  MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                                    When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                                    honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.

                                    Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                                    Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.

                                    If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                                    backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                                    protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.

                                    If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                                    protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                                    "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                                  When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the

                                                  A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
                                                  The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`

                                                  When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowHeaders` field
                                                  specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more

                                                  header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as

                                                  response header, instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway

                                                  A CORS-safelisted method is a method that is `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`.
                                                  (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-method) The
                                                  CORS-safelisted methods are always allowed, regardless of whether they
                                                  are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                                  When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the
                                                  gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header
                                                  which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                                  If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                                  is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                                  `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                                  side.

                                                  The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                                  wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                                  When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowMethods` field
                                                  specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                                  in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                                  value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                                  `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                                  header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                                  the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
                                                  instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
                                                  choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                                  AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                                                  resource from the given `Origin`.

                                                  The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                                  takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

                                                  Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

                                                  Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                                  available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                                  assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                                  origins. This may affect origin matching.

                                                  The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                                  wildcard characters behave as follows:

                                                  * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                                    DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                                    `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                                    left of its position.
                                                  * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                                                  An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                                  from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                                                  When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                                  means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                                  `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                                  the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                                  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                                  client.

                                                  The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                                  always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                                                  If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                                  the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                                  cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                                  403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                                  the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                                  Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                                                  The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                                  wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                                  When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
                                                  specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                                  in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                                  instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                                  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                                  the client.

                                                  A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                                  that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                                  The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:

                                                  The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

                                                  When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                                                  this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                                                  client.

                                                  Header names are not case sensitive.

                                                  Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`

                                                  the body of the client request; and if so, how big that body is allowed
                                                  to be.

                                                  It is expected that implementations will buffer the request body up to
                                                  `forwardBody.maxSize` bytes. Bodies over that size must be rejected with a

                                                  of the filter.

                                                  If unset, or `forwardBody.maxSize` is set to `0`, then the body will not

                                                      and sent to the authorization server. If the body size is larger than

                                                      to anything other than `0`, then the `Content-Length` of the authorization
                                                      request must be set to the actual number of bytes forwarded.

                                              RequestMirror defines a schema for a filter that mirrors requests.
                                              Requests are sent to the specified destination, but responses from
                                              that destination are ignored.

                                              This filter can be used multiple times within the same rule. Note that
                                              not all implementations will be able to support mirroring to multiple
                                              backends.

                                                  Mirrored requests must be sent only to a single destination endpoint

                                                  If the referent cannot be found, this BackendRef is invalid and must be

                                                  that is not allowed by a ReferenceGrant, the controller must ensure the

                                                  with the "RefNotPermitted" reason and not configure this backend in the

                                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                                implementations must support core filters.

                                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                                specific vendors.
                                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                              Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                                    description: |-
                                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                        implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                                        weights does not need to equal 100.

                                        If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                                        of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                                        traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight

                                  Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                                  this rule.

                                  Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                                  they are specified.

                                  Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                                  any combination or order of filters that cannot be supported. If implementations
                                  choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                                  that behavior.

                                  To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                                  consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                                  in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                                  a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                                  "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.

                                  Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

                                  - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                                  - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                  - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                                    implementations.

                                  Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                                  indicated in the filter.

                                  All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                                  URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                                  implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly

                                            When set to true, the gateway will include the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`

                                            Header names are not case sensitive.

                                            response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                            When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the
                                            gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                            which value is present in the `AllowHeaders` field.

                                            If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                            does not recognize by the client, it will also occur an error on the

                                            A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
                                            The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
                                            wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                            When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowHeaders` field
                                            specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more
                                            HTTP headers in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response
                                            header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as
                                            the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provided by the client. If
                                            the header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` is not included in the
                                            request, the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
                                            response header, instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway
                                            implementation may choose to add implementation-specific default headers.

                                            Valid values are any method defined by RFC9110, along with the special
                                            value `*`, which represents all HTTP methods are allowed.

                                            Method names are case sensitive, so these values are also case-sensitive.
                                            (See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-5.1.1)

                                            response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                            A CORS-safelisted method is a method that is `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`.
                                            (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-method) The

                                            are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                            When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the
                                            gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header
                                            which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                            If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                            is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                            `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                            side.

                                            The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                            wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                            When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowMethods` field
                                            specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                            in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                            value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                            `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                            header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                            the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
                                            instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
                                            choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                            The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and

                                            Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

                                            Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of

                                            * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                              DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                              `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                              left of its position.
                                            * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                                            An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                            from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                                            When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                            means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                            `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                            the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                            `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                            client.

                                            The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                            always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                                            If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                            the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                            cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                            403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                            the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                            Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                                            The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                            wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                            When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
                                            specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                            in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                            instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                            `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                            the client.

                                            ExposeHeaders indicates which HTTP response headers can be exposed
                                            to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.

                                            A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                            that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                            The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                                            `Cache-Control`
                                            `Content-Language`
                                            `Content-Length`
                                            `Content-Type`
                                            `Expires`
                                            `Last-Modified`
                                            `Pragma`
                                            (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name)
                                            The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

                                            When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                                            this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                                            client.

                                            Header names are not case sensitive.

                                            Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
                                            response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                            A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                                            to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                                            use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                            BackendRef is a reference to a backend to send authorization

                                            The backend must speak the selected protocol (GRPC or HTTP) on the
                                            referenced port.

                                            If the backend service requires TLS, use BackendTLSPolicy to tell the
                                            implementation to supply the TLS details to be used to connect to that
                                            backend.

                                            It is expected that implementations will buffer the request body up to

                                            of the filter.

                                            If unset, or `forwardBody.maxSize` is set to `0`, then the body will not

                                                body of the request to the authorization server.

                                                to anything other than `0`, then the `Content-Length` of the authorization

                                                match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                                Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                                ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                              and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                              well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                            * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                              Listener port.

                                            Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                            header in the following cases:

                                        Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                        types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                        - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                          "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                          implementations must support core filters.

                                        - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                          "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                          are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                        - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                          specific vendors.
                                          In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                          implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                          conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                          is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                          "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                        Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                        extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                        If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                        MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                        that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                                ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                                match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                                Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                                ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                  Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                                  HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                                  if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

                                  For example, take the following matches configuration:

                                  ```
                                  matches:
                                  - path:
                                      value: "/foo"
                                    headers:
                                    - name: "version"
                                      value: "v2"
                                  - path:
                                      value: "/v2/foo"
                                  ```

                                  For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                                  EITHER of the two conditions:

                                  - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                                  - path prefix of `/v2/foo`

                                  See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                                  match conditions that should be ANDed together.

                                  If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                                  path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                                  HTTP request.

                                  Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                                  MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                                  ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                                  given to the match having:

                                  * "Exact" path match.
                                  * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                                  * Method match.
                                  * Largest number of header matches.
                                  * Largest number of query param matches.

                                  Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.

                                  If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                                  determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

                                  * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                                  * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                                    "{namespace}/{name}".

                                  If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                                  to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                                  criteria.

                                  When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                                  parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                              Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                              case-insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                              If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                              entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent

                                              exact string match. (See
                                              https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).

                                              If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                              entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                              entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.

                                              If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                              purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                              capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                              match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                              as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                              the Gateway API.

                                              Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                              themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                                      retry attempts and is represented in Gateway API Duration formatting.

                                      For example, setting the `rules[].retry.backoff` field to the value
                                      `100ms` will cause a backend request to first be retried approximately
                                      100 milliseconds after timing out or receiving a response code configured
                                      to be retryable.

                                      An implementation MAY use an exponential or alternative backoff strategy
                                      for subsequent retry attempts, MAY cap the maximum backoff duration to
                                      some amount greater than the specified minimum, and MAY add arbitrary
                                      jitter to stagger requests, as long as unsuccessful backend requests are
                                      not retried before the configured minimum duration.

                                      If a Request timeout (`rules[].timeouts.request`) is configured on the
                                      route, the entire duration of the initial request and any retry attempts
                                      MUST not exceed the Request timeout duration. If any retry attempts are
                                      still in progress when the Request timeout duration has been reached,
                                      these SHOULD be canceled if possible and the Gateway MUST immediately
                                      return a timeout error.

                                      If a BackendRequest timeout (`rules[].timeouts.backendRequest`) is
                                      configured on the route, any retry attempts which reach the configured
                                      BackendRequest timeout duration without a response SHOULD be canceled if
                                      possible and the Gateway should wait for at least the specified backoff
                                      duration before attempting to retry the backend request again.

                                      If a BackendRequest timeout is _not_ configured on the route, retry
                                      attempts MAY time out after an implementation default duration, or MAY
                                      remain pending until a configured Request timeout or implementation
                                      default duration for total request time is reached.

                                      When this field is unspecified, the time to wait between retry attempts
                                      is implementation-specific.

                                      BackendRequest specifies a timeout for an individual request from the gateway
                                      to a backend. This covers the time from when the request first starts being
                                      sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.

                                      Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                                      completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                                      instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                                      the timeout can be set.

                                      An entire client HTTP transaction with a gateway, covered by the Request timeout,
                                      may result in more than one call from the gateway to the destination backend,
                                      for example, if automatic retries are supported.

                                      The value of BackendRequest must be a Gateway API Duration string as defined by
                                      GEP-2257.  When this field is unspecified, its behavior is implementation-specific;
                                      when specified, the value of BackendRequest must be no more than the value of the
                                      Request timeout (since the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout).

                                      Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
                                      If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
                                      MUST return a timeout error.

                                      For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
                                      `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
                                      to complete.

                                      Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                                      completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                                      instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                                      the timeout can be set.

                                      This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
                                      as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
                                      request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
                                      initiated by the client.

                                      The value of Request is a Gateway API Duration string as defined by GEP-2257. When this
                                      field is unspecified, request timeout behavior is implementation-specific.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                          a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                          value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.

                                  An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                  user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                  scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                  removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                  Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                          API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as
                                loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE.
                                When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for
                                mitigating container breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their

                                Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                unique among all containers.
                                Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                in a similar fashion.
                                Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                            RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                            recursively.

                                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                            If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                            None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                    seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                    It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                    Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                    "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                    This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                    "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                    This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                    It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                    Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                    whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                    CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                    "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                    and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                    This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                    All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                      MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                      to topologies that satisfy it.
                                      It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                      MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                      of pods into each bucket.

                                      - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                      - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                        but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                        skew.
                                      A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                      if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                      "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                      If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                      to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                      and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                      Use this if:
                                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                         tracking are needed,
                                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                         information on the connection between this volume type
                                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                      of an individual pod.

                                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                      more information.

                                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time.
                                    properties:

                                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                  provisioner.
                                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards

                                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                    specified.
                                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                    in any namespaces.

                                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                          fsType is filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
                                          Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                                          Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                      image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                      The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                      - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                      - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                      - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                      The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                      A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                      The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                      The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                      The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                      Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                      The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                          IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                          Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field
                                                of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

                                                Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

                                                ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                                                combination of signer name and a label selector.

                                                Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                                into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                                comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                                The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                                may change the order over time.

                                                Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                source in its spec.

                                                Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                timestamp.

                                                Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                certificateChainPath fields.

                                                The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                consistent.

                                                The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                use the certificates it issues.

                                                certificateChainPath:
                                                  description: |-

                                                    Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                    and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                    and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                    files mid-rotation.

                                                    Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                    The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                    The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                    key.

                                                    The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                    certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                    Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                    atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                    project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                    additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                    and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the

                                                    Valid values are "RSA3072", "RSA4096", "ECDSAP256", "ECDSAP384",
                                                    "ECDSAP521", and "ED25519".

                                                    maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                    certificate.

                                                    Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                    generates for this projection.

                                                    If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                                    will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                    value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                    The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                    lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                    seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                                    `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                                    longer than 24 hours.
